*Ahh yes*, tech in the 20th century, or more specifically:

## Computers!!!!

![True Magnificence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123292179/214828757-9e445c0f-1249-45cb-9a59-71d979a07506.png)

Isn't it beautiful?!

What? You're not convinced? How dare you!!! By the end of this post, you will realize how unnecessarily CLUTTERED our computers are with unacceptable `RAM`
sizes of 8 GB and `Computing Speeds` of more than 2 GHz! 

~or you will realize how HORRENDOUS computers used to be relative our fantastic computers~
 > Ignore that, that's just my rationality.

Now of course I could elaborate for hours on the magnifecence of **ALL** computers, but nothing outclasses:

## THE MACINTOSH 128K!!!

![GODLY MAGNIFECENCE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123292179/214824275-9c4072d1-efaf-446f-9ba8-7cb66c8382a3.png)

Isn't it **MAGNIFECENT**

Now what's even ~WORSE~ I MEAN *better* are the specifications, just listen for a moment :open_mouth::

1. `CPU`: A *Motorola 68000 microprocessor* with a speed of 7.8336 MHz 💻
2. `GPU`: A Graphics Card **integrared** into the CPU! 🔌
3. `Storage`: A practical *Floppy Disk Drive* with a *HEFTY* **400 KB** of storage! 💾
4. `RAM`: An *OVERWHELMING* 128 KB of Memory!! 🎱
5. `Display`: An *extravagently*  **Monochrome** display of 9 inches 512x342)! 🖥️
6. `Manufacturer`: Finally, the manufacturers of this device were of course ~the money hungry hippos~ Apple!
