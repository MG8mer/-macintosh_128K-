*Ahh yes*, tech in the 20th century, or more specifically:

## Computers!!!!

![True Magnificence](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123292179/215264493-39333297-7213-4e38-848a-0694f3665351.png)

> Isn't it beautiful?!

I mean, just look at it! Y'know? Look at all the detail! And the size of the hardware is just perfect! The convienient DVD player, the aesthetic of the mouse, and just imagine the *sounds* of the **keyboard!** ⌨️ 🖱️

What? You're not convinced? How dare you!!! By the end of this post, you will realize how unnecessarily **CLUTTERED** our computers are with unacceptable `RAM`sizes of 8 GB and `Computing Speeds` of more than 2 GHz, and you will begin to appreciate the complex design that *old* computers used to have and
the simplicity of the `specifications`!

~or you will realize how HORRENDOUS computers used to b-~
 > Ignore that, that's just my rationality. ;)

Now of course I could elaborate for hours on the magnifecence of **ALL** computers, but nothing outclasses:

## THE MACINTOSH 128K!!!

![GODLY MAGNIFECENCE](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123292179/214824275-9c4072d1-efaf-446f-9ba8-7cb66c8382a3.png)

> Isn't it **MAGNIFECENT** ✨

This is the *perfect* computer! You just can't get better! Other older pieces of hardware are great and all, but **this**:

## Yes Indeed!

The blocky aesthetic old desktops used to have was *refined* to **PERFECTION**, the geometry is just incredible, and of course you have a *beautiful* logo
on the bottom right corner, and a *convinient* DVD player **integrated** into the computer itself!

Now what's even *better* are the specifications, just listen for a moment:[^1]

1. `CPU`: A *Motorola 68000 microprocessor* with a speed of 7.8336 MHz 💻
2. `GPU`: A Graphics Card **integrared** into the CPU! 🔌
3. `Storage`: A practical *Floppy Disk Drive* with a *HEFTY* **400 KB** of storage! 💾
4. `RAM`: An *OVERWHELMING* 128 KB of Memory!! 🎱
5. `Display`: An *extravagently*  **Monochrome** display of 9 inches 512x342)! 🖥️
6. `Power`: An *incredible* power of **60 WATTS!** 🔌
7. `Manufacturer`: Finally, the manufacturers of this device were of course ~the money hungry hippos~ Apple! 🍎

## 😮

You see? Look at that! **Simplicity!** It is *EXACTLY* what you need in your day to day life! Just think about it, who needs 8 GB of `RAM`, who needs 256 GB of `storage`, it's just pure *insanity*, and what's even *WORSE* is that modern computer design is too *simplistic!* Look at this absurdness:

![Carnage](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/123292179/215273466-397f4776-66f9-421a-bafb-017dc1e557b6.png)

That is an image of the computer I am currently using to make this webpage, the `M1 Macbook Air 2020`. It would *most certainly* be preferable to be using an old computer, but I wouldn't be able to show my passion for this old technology. 

> I guess I was born in the wrong generation 😞

Either way,
